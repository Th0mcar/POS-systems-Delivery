system pos delivery


#This is an idea for a POS system designed exclusively for home deliveries. It arose from the need to organize delivery sales, as waiting times were often delayed and extended due to the slow handling of order-taking.

Though simple, its operation gets the job done: you copy and paste the data so the database can assign the price and print the order ticket. This ticket is then given to delivery personnel to ensure they receive information about their order as quickly and clearly as possible.
